            This is user guide for Tyrus &version;. We are trying to keep it up to date
            as we add new features. Please use also our API documentation linked
            from the
            <link xlink:href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.tyrus">Tyrus</link> and
            <link xlink:href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.websocket">Java API for WebSocket</link>
            home pages as an additional source of information about Tyrus features and API.

            If you would like to contribute to the guide or have questions
            on things not covered in our docs, please contact us at
