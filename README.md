Tyrus is the open source
[JSR-356](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356) - Java API for WebSocket reference
implementation for easy development of WebSocket applications. WebSocket protocol
defined by IETF provides bi-directional communication between the server and
the remote host. The pros are mainly the ability to communicate both ways,
low latency and small communication overhead. Therefore Tyrus and WebSocket
in general are suitable for web applications that require sending a huge volume
of relatively small messages like online games or market ticker broadcasting.
